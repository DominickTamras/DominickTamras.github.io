						<p>Cyber/Cross is a card-based, fighting game set in the retro futuristic city of Spectrum. Players control Avatars equipped with a unique deck of Skill Cards that allows them to perform powerful moves and abilities during combat. Fights take place in 3-lane stages where players can dodge between lanes to avoid projectiles and obstacles or maneuver through the lanes to get a jump on their opponents. Players fight in 1v1 tournaments between each other to see who will become the next Cyber/Cross world champion.</p>
						<p>There are a total of 3 different characters, each a certain archetype relate to fighting games: All-Rounder (Samurai) Grappler/Brawler (Officer) and MixUp/Zoner (Anarchist).Two levels also were created, featuring enviromental hazards that players have to avoid while fighting. Neo Tokyo features cars that occupy 2 lanes and stuns the players if they are hit, knocking them back in the middle lane and The Office Tower has electric floors that spawn in random lanes.</p>

									<p>NO TIME GO!!! is a fully complete 4 player CO-OP board game that a team and I created for our class. I was the lead designer for this project.</p>
									<p>The objective of the game is to work with your team mates to work together stop the ship from exploding. Complete 4 rounds of 4 tasks each to prevent the ship from exploding, solutions to the tasks are found in the Emergency Manuals tha teach player receives. Players have 4 minutes to finish all of their tasks each round.</p>
									<p>Our team and I worked remotely on this project, and due to this nature all of the content for the game was made in Table Top Simulator. All assets were then uploaded to Gamecrafter for a physical version of the game. We had a limited budget of 25$ and had to take into account the budget during the games development.</p>
									
									<p><b>Project Responsibilities: </b></p>

							<div class="descriptbg">
									<p>Hi there! I'm Dominick Tamras, a game designer, computer programmer, and graphic artist. I started programming in high school, and am now pursuing a BA degree in Interactive Entertainment and Game Design at the University of Southern California, where I'm gaining skills in game development and game engines such as Unity. </p>
									<p>Iâ€™m improving both my coding and design skills by making projects and attending game jams, and have also taken up graphic design, working in both Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. Some of my artwork was created as a paid item and others are personal works made to improve my skillset. </p>
									<p>I've found great passion in both art and programming, so naturally I find myself leaning to continue a career in game development. Collaborating with a team to make a project, is a big part of the excitement of making games. I'm always learning the newest technologies, so that I am able to design and develop interactive experiences that can be enjoyed globally by a wide range of audiences.</p>
									<p><b>I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities, either to join a game company, or to help potential clients with interesting projects. Be it coding, game development or graphic design, if you have interest in my skillset, send me an email!
									</b></p>
