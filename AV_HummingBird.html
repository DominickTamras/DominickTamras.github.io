							<p>AV HummingBird is an in-development project I've recently joined made in Unreal Engine 5. The gameplay will be a mix of Halo/Arena-shooters combined with Mecha style action. There will also be a strong, character-driven story told through visual-novel sequences when not fighting. The story, visuals and gameplay will be an homage to 90's Mech Anime </p>
							<p>Featuring a FPS-action focused gameplay with an emphasis in mastering movement, as the Mech can skate around, dash, double jump, combined with masterin the array of weapons and equipment the player can use.</p>
							<p>Current progression of the overall game can be found on X, at: https://x.com/AV_Hummingbird </p>
						
							
							<p><b>Project Responsibilities: </b></p>

							<li>Gameplay Engineer, in charge of programming the main movement controls of the mecha, using a custom player controller that is meant to replicate Gold Source style of feel and movement.</li>
							<li>Collaborating closely with designers to develop the feel of the current movement system, while also giving my own design input in the process.</li>
							<li>In charge of the Git repo, making sure to handle any merge conflicts and set up other team memebers on the git.</li>
							<li>Team right now consists of 25 people, where we attend bi-weekly meetings to give updates on current tasks and progress.</li>

									Another bit of early work, testing the skating mechanic. Essentially our version of 'sprint' but instead the mech would move along with lower friction, allowing them to slide around. Here also is an idea of gaining speed when looking left or right to increase velocity.</div>

										Movement is going to be a crucial part of our game, here I'm testing our dash mechanic going against a ramp, resulting in big air time. Giving players techniques they can discover can create endless gameplay potential!</div>

									This is a portion of code that the enemy predicts the player's movement, grabbing it's transform and comparing it to the prediction's distance. I wanted to optimize the prediction to not be too powerful, so I included a dampener that would make it a smooth transition rather than an instant lock on.
