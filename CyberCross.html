							<p>Cyber/Cross is a card-based, fighting game set in the retro futuristic city of Spectrum. Players control Avatars equipped with a unique deck of Skill Cards that allows them to perform powerful moves and abilities during combat. Fights take place in 3-lane stages where players can dodge between lanes to avoid projectiles and obstacles or maneuver through the lanes to get a jump on their opponents. Players fight in 1v1 tournaments between each other to see who will become the next Cyber/Cross world champion.</p>
							<p>There are a total of 3 different characters, each a certain archetype relate to fighting games: All-Rounder (Samurai) Grappler/Brawler (Officer) and MixUp/Zoner (Anarchist).Two levels also were created, featuring enviromental hazards that players have to avoid while fighting. Neo Tokyo features cars that occupy 2 lanes and stuns the players if they are hit, knocking them back in the middle lane and The Office Tower has electric floors that spawn in random lanes.</p>

												For the levels I wanted to emphasize the three lane mechanic in the game, via obstacles that would pressure the player if they stayed in the lane for too long. This is an example of one obstacle, that would electrify the floor and damage the player, if they stayed in the same lane for a short period of time.

												For the shaders, we wanted to have a strong sense of cyberpunk for the aesthetic, so I made shaders that would reflect this. One such is this fog shader gave off a sense of scale/height for the level, with the below half shrouded in this thick layer of blue.

												While the card abilities are an essential part of the game, the other half is the base fighting mechanic. I programmed the fight moves and colliders, that worked in tanget with the animations.

												Much of the UI of the game was designed to communicate well to the player of what's going on. One of these was a flame effect I made visually and coded to indicate in the final release of the game, when an ability was ready to use.
