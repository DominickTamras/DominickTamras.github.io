							<p>Bloompunk is a resource management FPS Roguelike where your weapons & abilities are alive and grow on your body. </p>
							<p>This game is a work in progress, featuring challenges to complete and and earn abilities and passives, grow and adapt your playstyle with an evolving body and weapon.</p>

											Our game has a lot of moving parts, so engineering collaborated with sound designers to make an event request sheet, where sound designers would request an event to be made and they can access easily in Engine. I was in charge of implementing weapon related events.

												Using the built in post process effects in Unity, making something like the death screen had to really immerse the player as being this robotic entity. A lot of the other U.I in the game had to reflect this as well, including even down to the buttons.

									Gun feel was incredibly important for our experience goals, as we want the player to really feel the power behind their weapon, especially when it evolves. I added things like recoil, and a procedural gun kickback as examples of game feel that really showcases the power behind the gun. I took inspiration from FPS titles such as Destiny and DOOM (2016/Eternal) for how those games approach gun feel. I also started to set up pipelines for art to make it easy for them to add assets into the game and worked closely with them and sound on when gun VFX and SFX was ready and made sure it was easy to swap those in and out from the inspector.							</div>

									Here was more polishing on the gun kick-back and as well testing out the multi-shot passive of the gun. The first image above was me trying to figure out how to approach the 'shotgun' programically, but we decided to go away from traditional weapon archetypes and let the weapon evolve and allow players to create the weapon in the way they want, turning it into a long range shotgun sniper or a rapid-fire multishot SMG.

										An important tool I made in the game was an obstacle manager. Essentially this manager would allow us to make a variety of obstacles by just changing some values, making objects spawn or creating events. From something simple as a spinning laser obstacle as shown at the start to something a bit more complex, with a trigger attached to spawning a cage around the player and forcing them to fight inside it. I made the use of this manager easy to handle for quick iterations.

									This is a portion of code that the enemy predicts the player's movement, grabbing it's transform and comparing it to the prediction's distance. I wanted to optimize the prediction to not be too powerful, so I included a dampener that would make it a smooth transition rather than an instant lock on.
