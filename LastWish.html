							<p>Last Wish is an in-progress boomer shooter, featuring a lasso mechanic where you can pull enemies in and kick them around. This is mainly a focus on getting to know the Godot engine, but I do want to eventually make this a full title.</p>
							
						
							
							<p><b>Project Responsibilities: </b></p>

							<li>Lead Technical Designer - Currently I am the man designer for the game, so this at the moment includes level, gameplay mechanics, and combat/enemies. </li>
							<li>Additionally as a designer, I am also programming for the game too, using GDScript in Godot.</li>
							<li>Currently the game is in prototype phase as I work with a friend on developing out the game.</li>
							<li>Using Blender for 3D models. Texturing and modeling will be done by me.</li>
							<li>Created a game design doc to work as a basic outline, expanding as we develop the game..</li>

									This is the latest testing with the game so far, here I'm playing around with how shooting feels, kick and pulling as well using a basic enemy set up. I want to really nail the balance of quick combat. I implemented early player feel too, using camera shake when shooting.</div>

										This here is a little earlier iteration and I'm testing how enemies react when being underneath the player.</div>

									Taking into account different states and screens within our Collections page, it's important when setting up the Blueprints to check for the context the skin was in. Here for example, when viewing this skin on our Buddies screen, the Vandal's mountains and cloud effects would already be appearing and the animation won't play. This was a deliberate choice as to not make the effects play each time when switching to a different buddy.

										Sometimes weapons, especially the melee would have models unique to the Collections screen that our team have to develop. Here the Kuronami melee, had no chain that can be viewed in 3rd person since the original intent of the weapon was to be viewed in 1st person. I collaborated with an artist to design a unique chain model for Collections screen, then set it up in Blueprints with this new model while ensuring materials and effects still worked correctly for it. Each weapon as you may notice has a pivot when you hold the mouse on the weapon and move around, which also is usually critical in our melee set up. I developed a pivot point debug tool so we'd know where the pivot is at visually in engine to help this workflow faster.

									This is a portion of code that the enemy predicts the player's movement, grabbing it's transform and comparing it to the prediction's distance. I wanted to optimize the prediction to not be too powerful, so I included a dampener that would make it a smooth transition rather than an instant lock on.
