												Enemy tracking was pretty important, so to find a perfect balance, I made the bullets projectiles rather than hitscan/raycast, and the tracking accuracy changes how fast and how close the player is to the enemy.

												Using the built in post process effects in Unity, making something like the death screen had to really convey the player was this kind of robot, having an error screen and glitch effect reflect that.
