							<p>O is a 3D puzzle game that features a non-euclidean world. Players are sent inside of a blackhole and will explore this black and white world, with your trusty M.B.H (Miniature Black Hole). Being able to send out a blackhole that can be expanded, reversed and grab cubes with it to solve puzzles to reach the end.</p>
							<p>A total of 7 levels that with obstacles such as illusionary walls and time reversal to challenge the player and make them think with gravity. Our team collaborated with Berklee College of Music for the sound design of our game.</p>

												Levels were very crucial for the type of game we were making. I made many iterations for each level of the game, usually using pen and paper, so the player can progressively understand the mechanics presented to them at an exponential line. The most important however was getting the tutorial level down as perfect as I could get it. This picture is an example of top-down level design in my journal to layout the levels in the game.

												Nailing the aesthetic of the game was essential for our design goal of having this 'engima' of a dimension, to visualize to the players what the 'inside' of a black hole is. I took to shader code, shader graph and VFX graph to create these sort of effects and as well the outline shader for the entire game.

												One example of an obstacle I created is this time-rewind gateway. The player would enter the gateway, then have to complete the puzzle inside of it. If the timer reaches 0, the player resets back to their original position. This added tension between certain sections of levels for players.

												This is our production sheet that we followed closely. This helped us a lot as we'd write down our tasks and meet the deadline before the end of the sprint for it and really aided us to understand how big the tasks were, what to cut, what to keep, and so on. It acted as a great guideline to the design and completion of our game.
